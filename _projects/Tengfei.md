Under the guidance of the [FDUVIS](https://fduvis.net) Lab, led a research project on agent behavior generation. The project designed a complete pipeline that takes personality traits and scene information as input, generates simple activity schedules, and produces 3D skeletal animations using diffusion-based generative models.
